In other words, it compares multiple observed proportions to expected probabilities.\nThe formula is:\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\nwhere O_i is the observed frequency, E_i is the expected frequency for each categorym and k is the number of categories.\nFor more information about the technique, consult your lecture slides and tutorial 7."

    "text": "Exercise 2: hermit crabs\n\nBackground\nIn a study of hermit crab behaviour at Point Lookout, North Stradbroke Island, a random sample of 3 types of gastropod shells was collected. Each shell was then scored as being either occupied by a hermit crab or empty. Do hermit crabs prefer a certain shell?\n\n\n\nShell species\nOccupied\nEmpty\n\n\n\n\nAustrochochlea\n47\n42\n\n\nBembicium\n10\n41\n\n\nCirithid\n125\n49\n\n\n\nThe data is stored in a table object in R below. Note that it is different from a data.frame object. You can verify this by using the str() or class() functions.\n\ncrabs &lt;- as.table(\n    rbind(\n        Aus = c(47, 42),\n        Bem = c(10, 41),\n        Cir = c(125, 49)\n    )\n)\n\ncolnames(crabs) &lt;- c(\"Occupied\", \"Empty\")\nstr(crabs)\ncrabs\n\n\nData exploration\nSince we have a multi-dimensional dataset, we can try to plot the data to visualise it.\nA mosaic plot is a graphical representation of the data in a two-way contingency table. It is a way of visualising the relationship between two categorical variables.\nTry the code below. Can you interpret the plot?\n\n# mosaic plot of crabs\nmosaicplot(crabs, main = \"Hermit crabs and shell species\")\n\n\n\nClick here to view interpretation\n\nThe plot shows that the distribution of hermit crabs in the different shell species is not equal. The majority of hermit crabs are found in the Cirithid shell species, followed by Austrochochlea and Bembicium. This can be observed by the width of the boxes in the plot.\nThere are also differences in the number of empty shells in the different shell species. The Bembicium shell species has the highest number of empty shells, followed by Austrochochlea and Cirithid. This can be observed by the height of the boxes in the plot.\n\n\n\n\nHATPC\nNow it is your turn to test the hypothesis that the three shell species are equally preferred by hermit crabs. Follow the HATPC process with the following questions in mind (but you don’t have to answer them individually):\n\nWhat are the null hypothesis and alternative hypotheses?\nDoes the data satisfy the assumptions of a \\chi^2 test?\nHow should you report the critical value, p-value and df in a scientific paper?\nBased on the p-value, do we accept or reject the null hypothesis?\nWrite a scientific (biological) conclusion based on the outcome.\n\nUse the markdown structure below to answer the questions (if you wish):\n## Exercise 2: hermit crabs\n### Hypothesis\n### Assumptions\n### Test statistic\n### P-value\n### Conclusions\nTake your time, and when you are ready, check your answers with your demonstrators."
